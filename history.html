        WHAT WAS THE FIRST GOOGLE EASTER EGG?<br>
        Well, the first Google easter egg was made in 1998.<br>
        But, sadly, this Google easter egg no longer exists.<br>
        This is what it did:<br>
        If you searched "Google" in the search bar, it would say "Did you mean... BackRub?"<br>
        WHY?<br>
        Well, Google's original name was "BackRub". But, they renamed it to Google.<br>
        -----------------<br>
        WAS GOOGLE ACTUALLY NAMED GOOGLE?<br>
        No...it was a mistake.<br>
        What happened was that they were going to name it Googol.<br>
        If you search Googol in the search, that equals a BIG number.<br>
        That qualifies that this searching engine had a lot of information.<br>
        But, when they registered the domain name, they accidentally spelled "ol" into "le".<br>
        That turned Googol into Google.<br>
